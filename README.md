# WARNING

## Hold up!
**I do not recommend that you use this yet!**

## Why?

This needs a lot more testing on an empty account or super limited IAM credential set.
It will be done soon, haven't had the time to test it properly yet.

Getting closer

@todo standardize output style of help messages and instructions etc




# AWS Static Site Deployment Toolkit

This repository contains a set of scripts which are intended to help in deploying and 
managing static websites using AWS infrastructure. It automates the process of setting
up an S3-backed static site with CloudFront CDN, SSL enforced and supplied via an
auto-renewing cert via ACM, and DNS routing through Route53.

Should these scripts possibly generate Cloudformation, Terraform, or some another IAC type
configuration format, rather than using the AWS CLI / HTTP API manually?  Wouldn't that
provide better support going forward without being locked into a funky custom toolchain?  Well
what a good idea I certainly didn't think of that midway through working on this.  Maybe v2 üòò


### Features

- **One-command deployment** of a complete static website infrastructure
    - After infrastructure provisioning, **One-command** site content deploy and sync
- **Auto-renewing SSL certificates** via AWS Certificate Manager
- **CloudFront distribution** with reasonable caching defaults
- **Private S3 bucket** with proper security configuration
   - **OAC** rules limit provide access to the CF instance
- **Automatic DNS configuration** via Route53
- **Status tracking** for error recovery and resource management
- **Complete cleanup tool** to remove all created resources
- **Limited humor** because honestly we are all on a deadline here people, a script toolkit doesn't need to be making fun of us the **entire** fucking time


## Prerequisites and Installation

- AWS CLI installed and configured with appropriate permissions
- `jq` command-line JSON processor
- An existing Route53 hosted zone for any of the domains you wish to use
- Bash shell environment
- Clone this repository, export your creds, run login.sh
    - Create shell aliases if you feel like it, but as I said earlier, i'm not your dad


## Usage

### AWS CLI config basics

- Run `src/login.sh` to sanity check your environment and credentials
- Confirm the AWS account ID and credentials are appropriate for the target domains


### Deployment

Deploy a static website with a single command:

```
src/deploy-site.sh --domain [yourdomain.com] [options]
Options:
  --domain DOMAIN              Domain name (required)
  --profile PROFILE            AWS CLI profile (optional)
  --region REGION              AWS region (default: us-east-1)
  --status-file FILE           Custom status file path
  --yes                        Skip all confirmation prompts
  --help                       Display this help message

```

### Redirect

Add non-authoritative domain redirects with the redirect companion script.

```
Usage: ./deploy-redirect.sh --source-domains [domains,list,as,csv] --target-domain [domain]
Options:
  --source-domains DOMAINS     Comma-separated list of source domains to redirect (required)
  --target-domain DOMAIN       The destination domain for redirects (required)
  --profile PROFILE            AWS CLI profile (optional)
  --region REGION              AWS region (default: us-east-1)
  --status-file FILE           Custom path for status tracking file
  --yes                        Skip all confirmation prompts
  --help                       Display this help message

```


### Cleanup

When you no longer need the static site, you can remove all resources with either the
`remove-site.sh` or `remove-redirect.sh` scripts.  These accept the json status files from
either process, so make sure you didn't lose those!  You lost them already?  Oh.


## Deployment Timeline

Some of the steps involved take a while to fully deploy, and the scripts will keep checking on them
until things settle, eg: ACM cert validation, CF distribution deployment, yadda yadda.


## Error Recovery

The toolkit maintains a detailed status file (`deployment_status.json`) that tracks the progress of each step.
If an error occurs during deployment, you can attempt to fix the issue and run the script again - it will 
automatically skip completed steps and continue from where it left off.


## Updating Your Website

### Using the Sync Script

The toolkit includes a dedicated sync script that makes updating your website content easy and efficient:

```
src/sync.sh --status-file [file] [options]

Options:
  --status-file FILE       Status file from deployment (default: deployment_status.json)
  --source DIRECTORY       Local directory to sync (default: current directory)
  --profile PROFILE        AWS CLI profile to use
  --region REGION          AWS region (default: us-east-1)
  --paths PATHS            CloudFront paths to invalidate (default: /*)
  --gzip                   Enable gzip compression for text-based files
  --exclude PATTERN        Exclude files matching pattern (S3 sync exclude pattern)
  --dry-run                Show what would be uploaded without making changes
  -y, --yes                Skip all confirmation prompts
  --help                   Display this help message

```


### Manual Updates

If you prefer to use the AWS CLI directly, you can update your website as follows:

```bash
aws s3 cp your-files/ s3://yourdomain.com-static-site/ --recursive
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id YOUR_DISTRIBUTION_ID --paths "/*"

```

The distribution ID is provided in the deployment summary and also stored in the status file.


## Considerations and Limitations

- **CloudFront Distribution Removal**: When removing resources, CloudFront distributions need to be disabled first and can take 5-10 minutes to complete.
- **ACM Certificate Region**: Certificates for CloudFront must be in the `us-east-1` region regardless of your website's region.
- **DNS Propagation**: After deployment, it may take some time (minutes to hours) for DNS changes to propagate globally.
- **Costs**: While this toolkit creates resources within the AWS Free Tier limits for many users, standard AWS charges apply for the created services.
- **Custom Error Pages**: The default setup includes a basic error page. For custom error handling, upload additional error documents to S3 and update the CloudFront configuration.
